/**
 * An Injector constructs objects based on it's configuration. The Injector
 * tracks dependencies between objects and uses the bindings defined in its
 * modules and parent injector to resolve the dependencies and inject them into
 * newly created objects.
 *
 * Injectors are rarely used directly, usually only at the initialization of an
 * application to create the root objects for the application. The Injector does
 * most of it's work behind the scenes, creating objects as neccessary to
 * fullfill dependencies.
 *
 * Injectors are hierarchical. [createChild] is used to create injectors that
 * inherit their configuration from their parent while adding or overriding
 * some bindings.
 *
 * An Injector contains a default binding for itself, so that it can be used
 * to request instances generically, or to create child injectors. Applications
 * should generally have very little injector aware code.
